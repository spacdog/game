# game
Welcome to "game" I don't have a title for it yet, it just runs on openspades (an open source engine for voxlap)<br />
I recommend when you go into the game, click "Setup" and change your ingame name.<br /><br />																								
THIS GAME IS ENTIRELY FREE AND I MAKE GAMES AS A HOBBY AND NOT A PROFESSION.<br /><br />
