# game
Welcome to "game" I don't have a title for it yet, it just runs on openspades (an open source engine for voxlap)<br />
I recommend when you go into the game, click "Setup" and change your ingame name.<br /><br />																																																																																																														
***NEW POST-CHRISTMAS UPDATE***<br />
added:<br /><br />
new standard rifle<br />
changed candy axe back to scythe<br />
removed the santa hat<br />

**NEXT UPDATE IN 2 WEEKS, STAY TUNED FOR MORE CHANGES**
